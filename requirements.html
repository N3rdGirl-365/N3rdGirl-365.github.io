<h1>Requirements Specification for NotificationCentral</h1>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>1.1 Purpose of Product</p>
<t>This project will consist of a notification computer app that can organize all of your notifications into one central place. Instead of getting annoying individual notifications for every little thing, our app will condense and organize those notifications down into simple tiles that can be expanded to read more about your notifications. That way, when you go to check your notifications for the day and catch up on what you missed, you can simply open this app and see everything all at once. And while you are away, it will tell you if you have a lot of messages building up on a couple of apps, or if something you marked as important needs your attention, so that you never forget to keep up with your email, messages, assignments, and more.
<br>
<p>1.2 Scope of Product</p>
<p>The project will condense a user’s notifications. The deliverables will be a java based program for generated content read from a csv file. There will not be an API element at this stage, as it would be too complex for the time allotted. The main focus will be on correctly showing the notifications and working on the GUI.</p>
<h3>1.3 Acronyms, Abbreviations, Definitions</h3>
<p>&emsp;NC – notification central team</p>

<h1>2. General Description of Product</h1>
<p>This project is a computer application designed to allow a user better control over their notifications. It will let the user design the setup to select 4 media platforms to pin as well as a general notification section. It will consistently run and show the platform name, ~35 characters of the message, and a time stamp. 
This will organize all notifications into one central place, and if more information is needed, the user can select a tile and expand it or be taken to the website.</p>
