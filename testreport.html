<h1>Test Report</h1>

<h4>1. Component Testing</h4>
<p>Component testing was done by making smaller test of key code tasks, such as csv file reading, creating buttons, clicking to expand buttons, 
implementing a scroll bar and adding icons to the buttons. Each of these specific tasks were done with smaller code that was run separately 
from the final project and developed with simplified problem sets until the mechanics were fully understood and the code was developed enough 
to be grafted to the system.</p>
<h4>2. System Testing</h4>
<p>For testing the system, we focused on running relevant pieces of the code and commenting out others until the desired tasks (button "clicks" and 
"unclicks" or scroll bar is sensitive to trackpad). This prevented us from trying to fix too many problems at one, and we could identify where 
the issue was much faster. This sort of incremental programming helped keep us on track, although it can take awhile if we wrote a lot of code and 
only tested it at the end.</p>
<h4>3. Acceptance Testing</h4>
<p>Most of this testing was having meetings where teammates used the system and discussed if it was meeting user needs. We highlighted how shortcut-friendly
it was, how helpful the icons were, if the click to expand feature was clear enough.</p>
