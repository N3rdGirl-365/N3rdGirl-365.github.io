Overview of project
	Create a central notification window for all incoming notifications to be shown. Sits on the left side of the users’ screen by default and as 5 windows for 4 specific notification brands (canvas, discord, github, outlook, etc) and one “other” section. Wil show the most recent notification (first~10 chars) and when clicked will expand to show all unseen notifications (~150 chars).

		eventually, for further testing, add full list of notifications
			G-mail, Github, Microsoft Exchange, Discord, Reddit, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Lyft, Uber, Google Drive, Steam, GroupMe
	Reading in CSV file

Notification window
	Scroll bar
	Formatting buttons
		Sizing, change on click
		Logos
	Color

Buttons
	Read in notifications, have "canvas"-es go with canvas, "discord"-es go with discord
	Click to expand message, click again to resize back to small
	Only show most recent notification (stack data object?), click to see all the notifications
		scroll bar?	

Multi threading
